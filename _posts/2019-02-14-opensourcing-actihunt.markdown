I've decided to open-source an old and rusty project called [Actihunt](http://www.actihunt.com) that sits there for more than 3 years.

The project does one thing and one thing only, it syncronizes activities between Runkeeper and Strava, this is all, and it did its job pretty well in all this time.

[Bitbucket source code](https://bitbucket.org/icostan/actihunt) and [SemaphoreCI](https://semaphoreci.com/icostan/actihunt) and a few screenshots for the curious minds.

### Activities index page

It shows activities listing for the selected provider where you can 'Sync' or view activity details by clicking on 'Show', see below.

### Activity details page

Nothing fancy here, just a few activity details.

### Account page

And finally the account page, with name/email/timezone and connected providers.
