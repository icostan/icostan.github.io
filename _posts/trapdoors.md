By far the most important cryptographic primitive is the trapdoor.
- a function that is very easy to compute in one direction but is infeasible to calculate the inverse

## Trapdoors:

1. prime factorization
2. discrete logarithm
3. lattice
4. others

## 1. Integer factorization in RSA

## 2. Discrete logarithm in ElGamal

## 3. Lattices
